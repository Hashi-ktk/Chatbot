a 2% employment quota for persons with disabilities in organizations, including corporate companies and private businesses, that have 100 or more employees. 2. Penalties for Non -compliance : o Companies that fail to comply with this quota are required to pay a fine into a special fund.

For example, the Punjab Disabled Persons (Employment and Rehabilitation) Amendment Act, 2015, also reinforces these obligations at the provincial level. 5. The Constitution of Pakistan : o Article 38(d) of the Constitution emphasizes the state’s responsibility to ensure the protection of persons with disabilities and their inclusion in economic activities, further reinforcing the importanc e of such legal frameworks. Employers are legally obligated to meet these requirements and promote the inclusion of persons with disabilities in the workforce.
